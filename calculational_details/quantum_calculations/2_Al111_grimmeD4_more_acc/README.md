In this input file, I used:
- Grimme D4 dispersion correction
- Acccounted for electrostatic dipole moment, through dipole correction
- More accurate settings for the SCF calculation allowing for converged results
- Becareful that this cell is small and not practical yet maybe

We need to:
- test on bigger cell and allow more layers in the substrate
- test with different functionals (non-local functionals) for vdW-DF2...etc
- test with different basis sets that are more suitable maybe for this problem (I don't know yet)
