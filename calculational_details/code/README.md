This folder should contain in subfolders the proof-of-concepts for resource estimation of materials and algorithms.

Subfolder:
* braket_poc: stores example code for using braket (with qiskit)
* cordata_filter: notebook for filtering and calculating molecular weight of inhibitors from CORDATA
* qiskit_poc: several notebooks using qiskit_nature to predict active_space, ground_state
* estimate_phase1: code and files needed for estimating resources needed for braket phase1 (estimating performance of QPUs)
* qiskit-braket-provider: stores the code of the provider with patches integrated.
